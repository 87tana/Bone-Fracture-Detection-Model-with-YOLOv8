# Bone Fraction Detection 

Trained YOLO8 for bobe fracture detection
## Data  

This dataset includes 5,455 annotated X-ray images in YOLOv8 format, divided into training (3,779), validation (835), and test (841) sets. It focuses on single-class classification ("Fracture" vs. "No Fracture") with varying bounding box sizes and class distribution, requiring further analysis. Hosted on Roboflow, the dataset likely originates from medical institutions or research collaborations, though specific collection details are not provided.
