# Bone Fraction Detection 

Trained YOLO11n for bobe fracture detection
## Data  

This dataset includes 5,455 annotated X-ray images in YOLOv8 format, divided into training (3,779), validation (835), and test (841) sets. It focuses on single-class classification ("Fracture" vs. "No Fracture") with varying bounding box sizes and class distribution, requiring further analysis. [Hosted on Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/fracture-uofxm/bone-fracture-detection-ivsy6/dataset/1). the dataset likely originates from medical institutions or research collaborations, though specific collection details are not provided.
